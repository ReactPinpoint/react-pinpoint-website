/* COLOR PALETTE 18 */
/* 
Primary 

These are the splashes of color that should appear the most in your UI,
and are the ones that determine the overall "look" of the site. Use these
for things like primary actions, links, navigation items, icons, accent
borders, or text you want to emphasize.

Neutrals

These are the colors you will use the most and will make up the majority
of your UI. Use them for most of your text, backgrounds, and borders,
as well as for things like secondary buttons and links.
